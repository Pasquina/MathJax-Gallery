Number theory is the branch of pure mathematics concerned with the properties and relationships of integers (1,2,3...) and related objects. Often called "higher arithmetic," it explores prime numbers, divisibility, andDiophantine equations. Key branches include elementary, analytic, and algebraic number theory. It is essential for modern cryptography (e.g., RSA algorithm). 

## Key Aspects of Number Theory

-   **Basic Concepts:** Fundamental topics include divisibility, prime numbers (integers > 1 with no divisors other than 1 and themselves), modular arithmetic (calculating with remainders), and the Euclidean algorithm.
-   **Main Branches:**
    -   **Elementary NumberTheory:** Studies integers without advanced techniques, focusing on properties like divisibility and prime patterns.
    -   **Analytic Number Theory:** Uses calculus and complex analysis to study the distribution of prime numbers.
    -   **Algebraic Number Theory:** Studies algebraic integers and generalizations of integers to solve polynomial equations.
-   **Key Figures:**
    -   **Pierre de Fermat** is often considered the founder of modern number theory due to his work on prime numbers and, specifically, **Fermat's Last Theorem** ( $  {x^n} + {y^n} = z^n $ has no non-zero integer solutions for $ n > 2 $).
-   **Applications in Cryptography:** Number theory is crucial for security, particularly public-key systems like RSA, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large integers into their prime components.
-   **Famous Unsolved Problems:**
    -   **Riemann Hypothesis:** Concerns the zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the distribution of primes.
    -   **Goldbach's Conjecture:** Suggests every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
    -   **Twin Prime Conjecture:** Proposes that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by 2.

## Famous Results 

-   **Prime Number Theorem:** Describes the asymptotic distribution of prime numbers.
-   **Fermat's Last Theorem:** Proven by Andrew Wiles in 1994, closing a 300-year-old problem.
