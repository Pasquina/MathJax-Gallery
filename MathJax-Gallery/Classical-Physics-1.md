Classical physics is the study of matter and energy on a macroscopic scale, relying on deterministic, pre-1900 principles like [Newton's laws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJhqoWjlT8o) and Maxwell's equations. It covers everyday phenomena, including motion, mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. These theories are generally reversible and accurately describe the behavior of large, relatively slow-moving objects. 

## Key Aspects of Classical Physics

-   **Definition:** Physical theories predating quantum mechanics and relativity, focusing on cause-and-effect.
-   **Core Theories:**
    
    -   **Newtonian Mechanics:** Studies motion, force, and gravity.
    -   **Electromagnetism:** Maxwell's equations for light and electricity.
    -   **Thermodynamics:** Heat and energy transfer.
    -   **Optics:** Behavior of light.
    

-   **Deterministic Nature:** Assumes that if the current state of a system is known, its past and future can be predicted.

-   **Limitations:** Ineffective for microscopic (quantum) or extremely high-speed (relativistic) phenomena. 

## Key Founders: 

-   **Isaac Newton:** Formulated laws of motion and universal gravitation.
-   **James Clerk Maxwell:** Developed electromagnetism.
-   **Other Contributors:** Carnot, Joule, and Kelvin (thermodynamics). 

## Common Formulas:

-   **Newton's Second Law of Motion:** $ F = ma $. 
-   **Gravitational Force:** $ F = G \frac {m_1  m_2} {r^2} $.
-   **Kinetic Energy:** $ E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 $.
