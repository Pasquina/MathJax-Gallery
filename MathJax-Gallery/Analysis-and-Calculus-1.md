Calculus and analysis are intimately related branches of mathematics focusing on change, limits, and continuous functions, with calculus serving as the computational, applied toolkit (derivatives, integrals) and analysis providing the theoretical, rigorous foundation (proofs, $𝜖−𝛿$ definitions). Calculus deals with calculating quantities, while analysis explores the underlying properties and rigorous justifications for those calculations. 

## Key Distinctions 

-   **Calculus:** Often described as "computation-based," focusing on applying rules to solve specific problems in science and engineering (e.g., finding rates of change, areas). It is commonly taught as an introduction to these concepts.
-   **Analysis (Real/Complex):** The rigorous, theoretical study of the foundations of calculus, focusing on the "why" behind concepts like limits, convergence, and continuity. It uses abstract, formal, and logical reasoning .

## Relationship and Structure

-   **Evolution:** Analysis evolved from calculus, with [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis) noting that it formalizes the methods of limits, differentiation, and integration.
-   **Rigour:** Analysis is sometimes described as "calculus without proofs" versus "analysis with proofs".
-   **Application:** While calculus is used for computation, analysis is used to prove general statements and establish the foundations for, say, trigonometric functions. 

## Key Topics in Analysis

-   **Real Analysis:** Detailed study of real numbers, sequences, and functions.
-   **Complex Analysis:** Study of complex-valued functions.
-   **Functional Analysis:** Analysis on abstract, higher-dimensional spaces.

>While some contexts, particularly in Eastern Europe, treat them similarly as "mathematical analysis," many Western curricula distinguish them by difficulty and focus on proof.
