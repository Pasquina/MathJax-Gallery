## Statement
The electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the enclosed charge.

### Code
```text
\oint_{\partial V} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}
```

### Renders As
$$
\oint_{\partial V} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{Q_{\text{enc}}}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

### Why it belongs
An early example of symmetry, fields, and geometry working together.
