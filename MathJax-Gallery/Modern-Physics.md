Modern physics, developing from the early 20th century, investigates physical phenomena at extreme scales—the very small (atomic/subatomic) and the very large (relativistic speeds/cosmic scales). Key concepts include quantum mechanics, [relativity (special and general)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_physics), wave-particle duality, and atomic structure, which fundamentally altered the classical, deterministic view of the universe.

## Key Concepts and Theories 

-   **Quantum Mechanics:** Developed to explain the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic levels, introducing probabilistic rather than deterministic outcomes (e.g., Heisenberg uncertainty principle).
-   **Relativity (Special & General):** Formulated by Einstein, this theory studies space, time, and gravity, particularly at speeds approaching the speed of light.
-   **Wave-Particle Duality:** The concept that particles (like electrons) exhibit wave-like properties, and waves (like light) exhibit particle-like properties (photons).
-   **Mass-Energy Equivalence:** Expressed by $ 𝐸= 𝑚^2 $, showing that mass can be converted into energy, fundamental to nuclear physics.

## Main Branches and Areas 

-   **Atomic and Nuclear Physics:** Study of atomic structure and the nucleus.
-   **Particle Physics:** Investigation of fundamental particles (Standard Model).
-   **Condensed Matter Physics:** Study of solid and liquid phases of matter.
-   **Astrophysics and Cosmology:** Study of the universe's origin, evolution, and large-scale structures.
-   
## Limitations of Classical Physics & Applications  
Modern physics arose because classical physics (Newtonian mechanics, Maxwell’s electromagnetism) failed to explain phenomena involving high velocities, high energies, or very small distances.
-   **Applications:** It is the basis for technologies like lasers, transistors, nuclear energy, medical imaging (MRI), and GPS.
